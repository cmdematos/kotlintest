	It's useful to consolidate common properties in a single place.  Real-world projects may have more complex needs,
	but this demonstrates how a single configuration set can be used across the build environment and lifecycle.

	The assumption is that config.gradle is being applied to an object with ExtraPropertiesExtension support.
	Note that we're using this in both the init and configuration phases of the build.
